            The best way to reach the campus from abroad is first to go to Salerno. The nearest International Airport is Naples Capodichino (code NAP). You can take a bus (Alibus) from the airport to the central station in Naples and get off here for connections to Salerno through high-speed and traditional train services.
            <br><br>
            Frequent buses connect the city to the university. Specifically, buses number 7 and 17 ("Linea 7" and "Linea 17" in Italian) arrive at the university from the Salerno train station (Salerno FS).
            <br>
            More information on the bus route can be found on the main page of <a href="https://www.fsbusitalia.it/content/fsbusitalia/eng/campania/timetables-and-lines.html" target="_blank" class="">Busitalia</a>.

            <a href="https://www.fsbusitalia.it/content/fsbusitalia/it/campania/app-campania.html"  target="_blank" class="">A dedicated app, QuiBus Campania, is available for Android and iOS and allows rapid individuation of available routes. The app can be downloaded for Android or iOS (Italian language only!).</a>
            <br><br>
            Salerno is located about 60 km south of Naples and is considered a gateway to the Amalfi Coast. It offers much, from a medieval city center that takes you back to its ancient and prestigious origins to a seafront with modern and avant-garde architecture.

                        <b>Abstract.</b> With digitalization and with technologies such as software, data, and artificial intelligence, companies in the embedded systems domain are experiencing a fundamental shift in how they develop, deploy, maintain and evolve their systems. Also, dimensions such as how to align with partners for innovation and new value creation, as well as models for how to monetize this value change dramatically when physical systems are increasingly being complemented with software services, data-driven offerings, and digital products. This talk explores the opportunities that come with continuous deployment of software and how companies in the embedded systems domain can benefit from data collection and feature experimentation practices in the transition from traditional towards digital companies. The talk focuses on the changes associated with processes and ways-of-working, but also new engagement models for value creation and monetization. To illustrate the transition, the talk provides concrete examples based on action-oriented research conducted in close collaboration with companies in the the embedded systems domain.

In this keynote we highlight open research problems and challenges from an industrial perspective. This perspective draws on  our experience at Meta Platforms, which has been actively involved in software testing research and development for approximately a decade. As we set out here, there are many exciting opportunities for software testing research to achieve the widest and deepest impact on software practice. With this overview of the research landscape from an industrial perspective, we aim to stimulate further interest in the deployment of software testing research. We hope to be able to collaborate with the scientific community on some of these research challenges.

                        <b>Abstract.</b> Bots are applications that can react to various external stimuli, such as events triggered by tools or messages posted by users, and perform automated tasks in response. They often include conversational capabilities to interact with end-users through textual messages in the same communication channels as their human counterparts. Bots are widely used in various domains, including e-commerce, customer service, and education. Software development is no exception: bots can play a significant role in taming the complexity of software projects by automating repetitive tasks and communicating the outcomes back to stakeholders, designers, developers, and end-users. The recent advances in natural language processing and artificial intelligence— which led, for instance, to tools like ChatGPT and Bard— bring new opportunities and challenges to bot usage and development. In this talk, we will discuss the current role of bots in software engineering, best practices for (chat)bot development, and the challenges that lie ahead.

                        <b>Abstract.</b> While we all are convinced that Machine Learning can greatly help many different software engineering activities, from requirements elicitation to software testing and maintenance, there are probably some doubts that software engineering can help ameliorate machine learning-based systems. This talk wants to try to answer this question without asking chatGPT, but by presenting some first experiences carried out in our research group. The presentation will discuss some first attempts at healing machine learning models,  at improving the deployment and operation of federated learning systems and at provisioning heterogeneous resources to ease and optimise the training and inference phases of machine learning-based systems. The final goal is to try to identify some recurring problems and some open issues for a plausible research agenda.

            Mutation testing is the state-of-the-art technique for assessing the fault detection capacity of a test
            suite. Unfortunately, it is seldom applied in practice because it is computationally expensive. In this
            paper we explore the use of fine-grained traceability links at the method level (named focal methods), to
            drastically reduce the execution time of mutation testing. In previous work for Java programs we achieve
            drastic speedups, in the range of 530x and more. In this paper we lay the foundation for identifying such
            focal methods under test in C/C++ programs by relying on the LLVM compiler infrastructure. A preliminary
            investigation on an 3,5 KLOC C++ project illustrates that we can correctly identify the focal method under
            test for 47 out of 61 tests.

          <h4>Abstract</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Mutation testing offers stronger test adequacy than conventional structural coverage metrics. It employs
            mutants, which mimic the real software faults, to measure the fault detection capacity of a given test
            suite. Mutation testing has been shown to work on an industrial scale for embedded systems, however only for
            unit tests. Since it is common practice to use model-based design to analyze, and test embedded software, it
            is worthwhile to investigate mutation testing in the context of MATLAB/Simulink. In this paper, we propose a
            framework for mutation testing of Simulink models. We validate the framework by means of a line follower
            robot constructed with Lego/Mindstorm and modelled using a series of Simulink models.

          <h4>Abstract</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">
            <b>Background:</b>Knowing exactly what software change introduced a bug is of major importance for
            researchers and practitioners. Currently the correct identification of the commit including such software
            change can only been done manually, which is time consuming and very labor intensive.<br>
            <b>Goal:</b> To address this problem in an automated way, a solution is proposed based on the idea of using
            the regression test, designed to detect the bug.<br>
            <b>Method:</b> The idea is to execute the regression test on the changes prior to a bug fix change. If a
            change is found where the test works again, then the next change is the one that introduced the bug. In the
            same way, if a change is found where the test stops running, the next change will be the one that introduced
            the functionality and therefore the bug was introduced along with it and was always present.
            We apply this method on 348 bugs from 9 Java projects to check if it is possible to detect with that test
            the change that introduced the bug.<br>
            <b>Results:</b> We found that although it is possible to implement this idea in practice, although there are
            multiple limitations that prevent it from being realized in certain cases, either because of project
            constraints (in the form of construction problems) or because of limitations of the method itself.<br>
            <b>Conclusions:</b> In this paper we have proposed a preliminary study to validate the idea of using
            regression tests as a tool to detect the changes introduced by bugs. We have detailed the cases that we have
            found when carrying out the experiment. We have also presented the limitations of this method and the
            pending future work to reduce them.

            Re-using whole repositories as a starting point for projects is often done by maintaining a divergent fork
            in parallel to the upstream, but the common part between both is not always kept up to date. Patches are not
            optimally propagated between the two projects, which can cause long living bugs. A bug existing in both
            repositories can be fixed in one but not the other (missed opportunity), or it can be manually fixed in both
            (effort duplication). By investigating 37 upstream-divergent fork pairs with a total of 6,926 patches, we
            found that there are 301 cases of effort duplication and 270 cases of missed opportunities. We conclude that
            developers frequently create manual patches in the divergent fork that already exist in the upstream.
            Moreover, bugs that exist within the common code between the divergent fork and the upstream are seldom
            discovered by one of the respective developer teams, causing these bugs to be long-lived.

            Software health plays an important role in collaborative software development. My PhD research aims to
            analyse how the evolution of socio-technical characteristics in large open source software ecosystems
            affects the health of these ecosystems and their building blocks. In order to capture as many different
            dimensions of software health, I aim to combine both the human (social) and the technical aspects of
            collaborative software development activity. These dimensions will be integrated into computational machine
            learning models to allow us to predict change trends in software health, as well as recommendation models to
            improve future health, based on historical analysis. I will focus primarily on evolving software packaging
            ecosystems to study their health, as they are known to have large technical dependency networks, as well as
            strong social collabo- ration networks. In this extended abstract, I present the research questions I am to
            explore on the health of such packaging ecosystems.

            Many companies and institutions want to contribute to Open Source projects in order to ensure its

            paper is to simulate and compare the performance (in terms of the time and the cost) of a company hiring a
            number of developers in two different scenarios, where the hired developers are a) insiders, and b)
            outsiders. We will therefore use a method used in the research literature before to simulate the behavior of
            software projects and determine the best strategy. Developers are therefore assigned bugs to work on every
            round. During each round, a MOEA algorithm, NSGA-II, was used to evaluate the candidate assignments in terms
            of the time and the cost. With the current settings, the results show there is no significant difference
            between the two scenarios in the terms of the two performance metrics considered. Upon the results so far,
            it seems we cannot favor one of the scenarios over the other one, based on the time and the cost. We believe
            further statistical analysis on the obtained data could power up our conclusion in this regard.

          <p class="text-justify">
            Traceability in software engineering is the ability to connect different artifacts that have been built or
            designed at various points in time. Given the variety of tasks, tools and formats in the software lifecycle,
            an outstanding challenge for traceability studies is to deal with the heterogeneity of the artifacts, the
            links between them and the means to extract each.
            Using a unified approach for extracting keywords from textual information, this paper aims to compare the
            concepts extracted from three software artifacts: source code, documentation and tests from the same system.
            The objectives are to detect similari- ties in the concepts emerged, and to show the degree of alignment and
            synchronisation the artifacts possess.
            Using the components of three projects from the Apache Foundation, this paper extracts the concepts from
            ‘base’ source code, documentation, and tests (separated from the source code). The extraction is done based
            on the keywords present in each artifact: we then run multiple comparisons (through calculating cosine
            similarities on features extracted by word embeddings) in order to detect how the sets of concepts are
            similar or overlap.
            For similarities between code and tests, we discovered that us- ing pre-trained language models (with
            increasing dimension and corpus size) correlates to the increase in magnitude, with higher averages and
            smaller ranges. FastText pre-trained embeddings scored the highest average of 97.33% with the lowest range
            of 21.8 across all projects. Also, our approach was able to quickly detect outliers, possibly indicating
            drifts in traceability within modules. For similarities involving documentation, there was a considerable
            drop in similarity score compared to between code and tests per module – down to below 5%.

          <p class="text-justify">
            Contemporary open-source software (OSS) development promotes collaborative development. Software developers
            use a wide portfolio of automated tools and development bots for facilitating effort-intensive or repetitive
            activities. To do so, they use specific accounts associated to their preferred social coding platforms such
            as GitHub. Determining whether an account represents bot-like or human-like behaviour is important in
            socio-technical studies, for example to identify top contributors, predict contributor abandonment, assess
            the positive and negative impacts of using bots, and so on.
            This paper proposes a curated dataset of bot usage in 769 GitHub repositories corresponding to the
            development history of Rust packages (crates) distributed through the Cargo package manager. This dataset
            can be used for empirical studies about OSS development that require knowing about the presence of bots. To
            obtain and characterise the dataset, we extended the BoDeGHa bot identification tool [1] that analyses the
            commenting behaviour of bots and humans in GitHub issues and pull requests (PRs). Among the 19,530 accounts
            that commented in issues and PRs in 590 GitHub repositories, we only considered accounts with at least 20
            issue and/or PR comments. We identified 47 accounts as bots, 1,470 as human, 7 as mixed (identified as bot
            in some repositories and human in others), and 18,006 as unknown due to insufficient available comments.
            Upon manual evaluation, we found 15 bots to be false positives.

            The goal of BENEVOL is to bring together researchers who are working in the field of software evolution and
            maintenance. BENEVOL offers an informal forum to meet and to discuss new ideas, important problems and
            obtained research results.

          <p class="mt-4 mb-2 text-justify">
            BENEVOL accepts submissions in two categories:
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            <b>Technical papers</b> (max 4 pages main text + 1 page of references) will undergo a mild yet constructive
            review.
            We explicitly solicit papers in the early stages of research, which are still rather rough around the edges
            and would benefit from feedback from the community.
            Technical papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee, assessing whether they
            are within the scope of BENEVOL (i.e., software maintenance and evolution) and meet its quality criteria.
            Authors will be asked to improve their paper and submit a camera ready version that will be published in the
            <a href="http://ceur-ws.org">CEUR-WS.org</a> workshop proceedings.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            <b>Presentation abstracts</b> (max 1 page) report on research results that have already been published, or

            They will only be reviewed for relevance, and will not be included in the BENEVOL proceedings.
            When accepted, the 1-pagers will be made available on the website of the workshop.
            Of particular interest are summaries that try to provoke discussion, initiate challenging new avenues, etc.
